### Project Euler Problems
***
Project Euler is a website full of hundreds of math-based computer programming challenges. I've tackled a handful of their problems using Python 3.4, and will regularly update this repository as I continue to solve more.

#### [Problem 1](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/1%20multiples%20of%203%20or%205.py)
* Finds the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 that are below 1,000

#### [Problem 2](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/2%20even%20fibonaccis.py)
* Finds the sum of all even Fibonacci Numbers below 4,000,000

#### [Problem 3](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/3%20largest%20prime%20factor.py)
* Finds the largest prime factor of 600,851,475,143

#### [Problem 4](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/4%20palindromic%20products.py)
* Finds the largest palindromic number made from the product of 3-digit numbers

#### [Problem 5](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/5%20smallest%20multiple.py)
* Finds the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20

#### [Problem 6](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/6%20sum%20square%20differences.py)
* Considers the first 100 natural numbers, then finds the difference between the sum of their squares and the square of their sum

#### [Problem 7](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/7%2010001st%20prime.py)
* Finds the 10,001st prime number

#### [Problem 8](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/8%20largest%20product%20in%20series.py)
* Finds the 13 adjacent digits in a 1,000 digit sequence that produce the largest product

#### [Problem 9](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/9%20special%20pythagorean%20triplet.py)
* Finds the Pythagorean triplet whose terms sum up to 1,000

#### [Problem 45](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/45%20triangular%20pentagonal%20hexagonal.py)
* Finds the next number past 40,755 that is triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
