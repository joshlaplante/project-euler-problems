### Project Euler Problems
***
Project Euler is a website full of hundreds of math-based computer programming challenges. I've tackled a handful of their problems using Python 3.4, and will regularly update this repository as I continue to solve more.

#### [Problem 1](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante/blob/master/Python/Project%20Euler%20Problems/1%20multiples%20of%203%20or%205.py)
* Finds the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 that are below 1,000

#### Problem 2
* Finds the sum of all even Fibonacci Numbers below 4,000,000

#### Problem 3
* Finds the largest prime factor of 600,851,475,143

#### Problem 4
* Finds the largest palindromic number made from the product of 3-digit numbers

#### Problem 5
* Finds the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20

#### Problem 6
* Considers the first 100 natural numbers, then finds the difference between the sum of their squares and the square of their sum

#### Problem 7
* Finds the 10,001st prime number

#### Problem 8
* Finds the 13 adjacent digits in a 1,000 digit sequence that produce the largest product

#### Problem 45
* FInds the next number past 40,755 that is triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
